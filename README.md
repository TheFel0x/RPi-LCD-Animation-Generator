# RPi LCD Animation Generator
Takes frames and turns them into 20x16 pixel animation. Outputs Python file meant for Rapsberry Pi that has an LCD screen connected to the GPIO pins.

I orignally made it for [Arduino](https://github.com/TheFel0x/Arduino-LCD-Animation-Generator) to play "Bad Apple!!" on an LCD display.

This is an improved version.
